       "'A bank outage that left customers unable to pay for everyday goods before the start of the holiday weekend has largely been resolved. ANZ customers took to social media on Friday amid reports users were unable to access the bank’s online service since about midday. Customers also reported being unable to reach the bank via their telephone line, with one person stating that “everyone is having problems”. A spokesperson for the bank confirmed “most systems” were back online by about 5pm, including internet banking, ATMs, and the ANZ app. “However, we are still experiencing some instability across our Visa Credit Card transaction services.” the spokesperson said. “We recommend customers use Debit Card or Cash wherever accepted while our teams are continuing to work to resolve.” The spokesperson said the widespread outage was caused by a software issue which impacted a number of our “core systems” from 1.37pm. The issue resulted in multiple internal and customer facing programs to shutter, including branch services, debit, and credit car transactions. Nicole Spaccavento said she was shopping when her card was unexpectedly declined, despite there being sufficient funds for the purchase. “I tried to log in to the app and it wouldn’t load so I called my husband to see if he could, to no avail,” she said. “Had to leave my shopping and go to the branch and was told all systems down nationwide. “They were allowing $200 withdrawal through the ATM at the moment per customer – doesn’t help when my shopping total was over that. “Luckily, I managed to get $200 out of one account and another $200 out of another … Quite embarrassing when you are at the register.” The outage stirred frustrations among users who labelled the outage on the eve of a long weekend “outrageous”. Customers described being unable to gather “supplies” for the public holiday, with business account holders also impacted. “ANZ down. I am locked out of my account. Cannot pay rent or payroll. Just went to the branch and they have closed it,” Ben O’Brien wrote. “The young guy said they are all locked out of their own system and unknown when it will be up and running.” Adam Preen also reported being “locked out” of his ANZ business account on workers’ payday and was unable to reach ANZ by phone. “What am I supposed to tell people, sorry I can’t pay you today.

At that time, Cohen said in a tweet, “Not for long.” Cohen will relinquish his role as executive chairman when he is also appointed chairman.

The suit alleges that Black employees faced a racist and hostile work environment and were retaliated against after speaking up.

Billionaire Cohen, founder of the Chewy online pet supply store, will serve as CEO in addition to his other roles, the Texas-based company said Thursday, but won’t be compensated for the job. Cohen is the third CEO to take the helm of GameStop in the last two years, replacing former Amazon executive Matt Furlong, and the company has run through as many CFOs since 2019. GameStop has been struggling since the mid-2010s, when online gaming and sales started to surpass brick-and-mortar shopping for video games, and investors have pinned their hopes to turn the retailer around on Cohen's plan to modernize. Gamestop Corp. shares spiked just under 3% minutes after the opening bell Thursday on the news of the announcement. GameStop stock soared more than 1,500% in 2021 after Reddit traders coordinated a massive surge in the stock's price. Small-time market watchers encouraged thousands of people online to buy GameStop after a handful of Wall Street firms had shorted the stock, betting it would fail. When the stock started rising sharply, those same short-sellers were forced to close their bets against the company at hefty losses. A few investors with no formal education in finance or experience to speak of on the stock market became overnight millionaires, including small business execs, an engineer, a purchasing manager for an auto-parts retailer and a professional baseball hopeful.

Notably, Cohen will not be receiving any form of compensation for his service in these key positions, as stated in a press release issued by GameStop. Ryan Cohen, who had previously held the position of Executive Chair at GameStop, brings substantial experience and influence to the company. As of late June, his firm, RC Ventures, held the largest stake in the Texas headquartered company, with an ownership interest of 12.09%, according to data from FactSet. Forbes estimates Ryan Cohen’s personal net worth to be approximately $3.2 billion (approx. rupees 302 crores), underscoring his significant financial standing and influence in the business world.

He emphasised the necessity of addressing the company’s financial challenges and the importance of adapting to changing market conditions. As reported by CNBC, Cohen’s email said, “Prospering in retail means survival. If we survive, we stay in the game. Survival is avoiding the deadly sins that often lead retailers to self-destruct.

Indeed, Finbold has consulted ChatGPT for insights as millions of people await the delivery event for Tesla’s Cybertruck that is supposed to take place in September, as announced by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who back in April said that the “Cybertruck handover [would] hopefully be around the end of Q3 this year.” Although ChatGPT refused to give any specific figures, it did stress that the launch of the Cybertruck could have a positive effect on the TSLA price, particularly in regard to the short-term hype, which is commonly responsible for bringing up stock prices shortly after the influential event. As the AI chatbot noted: “This could be driven by increased media coverage, heightened interest from investors, and overall excitement surrounding the event. Depending on the level of hype and speculation, the stock price might experience a moderate to significant short-term increase.” That said, ChatGPT has also highlighted that the impact of the Cybertruck on Tesla’s stock price over the longer term would depend on its actual sales performance and contribution to the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer’s revenue: “If the Cybertruck proves to be a best-seller and significantly boosts Tesla’s bottom line, it could have a positive impact on the stock price over time. Conversely, if sales disappoint, it could lead to concerns among investors.” As the bot also correctly observed, the Cybertruck could help Tesla gain a stronger foothold in segments like pickup trucks, which might lead to a “more favorable long-term outlook for the company, potentially impacting the stock price positively.” As things stand, the price of the TSLA',\n",

And then there is US interest rates at 5.25-5.5% despite the Fed pause, making all risk assets look less attractive, plus a surging US dollar to factor in too. Bitcoin teasing that it is a safe haven play after all? Markets worry that US inflation will be stickier than hoped and that a soft landing could be for the birds.

       "  'Cryptocurrency markets surged higher Thursday, with the price of bitcoin (BTC) breaking above the $27,000 level alongside easing macro pressures. BTC earlier rose to just shy of $27,300 and was trading at $27,010 at press time, up 3.2% over the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures the performance of a broad basket of crypto assets, was up 3.8%, led by a 5.5% gain for the CoinDesk DeFi Index (DCF). COMP, AAVE and MKR, governance tokens of top DeFi lending platforms Compound, Aave, and Maker, enjoyed 21%, 10% and 5% gains, respectively. LDO, the token of the leading liquid staking platform Lido Finance, jumped nearly 9%. Ethereum scaling network Arbitrum’s ARB posted a 9.6% rally, recovering losses from earlier this month. The crypto advance happened alongside a modest rebound in U.S. stocks as the 10-year Treasury yield pulled back from a 16-year high, oil retreated from a 2023 high and the greenback slipped as well.

Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said in an X post that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly asked ETF filers to update their application to be able to approve and start trading next week because of a looming government shutdown.

Ether also made up some ground, rising above the US$1,600 resistance level before falling back to just below it. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with the Open Network’s (TON) Toncoin leading the winners. U.S. stock futures were up after Wall Street closed mixed on Wednesday.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency on Wednesday night briefly rose above US$26,800 for the first time in the past seven days, but soon retreated to around US$26,300. The U.S. dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of other major fiat currencies, reached a ten-month high of 106.84 on Thursday. A high DXY has been a bearish signal for cryptos and the S&P 500 alike, blockchain intelligence firm Santiment said Thursday on X (previously Twitter). However, Bitcoin has “held up well” despite the rise in the U.S. dollar. That “may indicate a breakout could come once the DXY settles down,” Santiment added. 💸 The #Dollar has crept up to its highest level since last November. Particularly since 2021, this has been a #bearish signal for #crypto and the #SP500.

       "  'Bitcoin (BTC) remains the world\\'s biggest and most liquid digital asset. Still, crypto traders are increasingly pricing higher volatility in bitcoin relative to ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value. The spread between dominant crypto options exchange Deribit\\'s forward-looking 30-day implied volatility index for ether (ETH DVOL) and bitcoin (BTC DVOL) has been consistently negative since Sept. 7, the longest such stretch since Deribit started the DVOL indices in early 2021. In other words, bitcoin\\'s implied volatility (IV) has topped ether for 20 straight days. Implied volatility is an estimate of the price turbulence over a specific period based on options prices. The spread briefly turned negative in March for the first time in nearly two years, reflecting the relative richness of BTC IV. Since then, it has become a norm in a sign of traders not looking beyond macroeconomic issues right now and being less interested in trading alternative cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has evolved as a macro asset since the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020, consistently taking cues from the Fed policy, the U.S. fiscal and banking sector developments, and sentiment in traditional markets. Of late, macro risks have piled up in the form of rising U.S. Treasury yields, stagflation risks, a strengthening dollar index, the lingering threat of a U.S. government shutdown and increased prospects of a deflationary crash in China, all denting the appeal of investing in risk assets, like bitcoin. Besides, expectations for a U.S.-based spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund keep traders squarely focused on the leading cryptocurrency. Ether, meanwhile, has fallen out of favor, thanks to Ethereum\\'s dwindling revenue and renewed inflationary tokenomics. That said, ether may see renewed investor interest later this year when the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4844 goes live. The upgrade will introduce \"proto-danksharding,\" to the Ethereum blockchain in a bid to reduce',\n",
       "  'While Bitcoin (BTC) remains on track to end its six-year streak of September losses, a modest pullback ahead of what could be an imminent federal government shutdown could put this month’s advance in jeopardy. The largest crypto by market capitalization changed hands at $26,800 during Friday afternoon hours, posting a 3.2% return this month so far. However, BTC has declined 1.6% from the $27,400 it touched for a short time on Thursday. Extending this weak price action into the weekend could put BTC’s provisional positive monthly return in jeopardy as the crypto began September at just about $26,000. Ether (ETH) traded mostly flat at around $1,660, as market participants anticipate futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETF) to go live early next week. Ripple’s XRP, Solana’s SOL and the Tron network’s native token TRON posted 3%-5% gains, outperforming the broader digital asset market. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was down 0.5%. “The oppressive macro uncertainty is still a major headwind,” Noelle Acheson, macro analyst and author of Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, noted Friday. “Bond markets around the world are flashing signs of distress, as yields have reached multi-year records in the US, UK, Germany and Japan to name just a few markets.” She added that the looming U.S. government shutdown adds to the uncertainty and noted that the U.S. consumer spending growth in Q2 was revised lower, an indication that consumers might not be that resilient to tightening financial conditions. “As scary as this may sound, during the 21 government shutdowns [in the past] the S&P 500 rose 55% of the time, generating an average return of 0.3%,” advisory firm Asgard Markets wrote in a Friday market report.

       "  'NEW YORK, Sept. 26, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Crypto traders are asking if the Bitcoin price can pump to $30,000, but new crypto presale Bitcoin Minetrix\\xa0is grabbing the headlines with its revolutionary no-fuss, no-rigs, low-cost stake-to-mine token. As the Bitcoin price holds above $26,000, Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) is catching the eye of traders as the first fully decentralized mining solution based on cloud computing, where stakers earn credits they can directly deploy to mine Bitcoin. Traders are no doubt also intrigued by the implications of the stake-to-mine feature because of its potential to alleviate selling pressure at launch, while also incentivizing long-term adoption. Within minutes of the presale opening, more than $100,000 was contributed to the soft cap initial fundraise goal of $15.6 million. There are 10 stages to the presale – from Stage 2 onwards the token price increases 10% at each stage. At this rate the presale could sell out its first stage, in which $3,080,000 is targeted, within a week. There really is no time to lose in locking in the lowest prices. You can stay in touch with the progress of the presale and how much has been staked by following the official X (formerly Twitter) account\\xa0and joining the Telegram\\xa0and Discord groups. https://twitter.com/bitcoinminetrix/status/1706601981790367852 New crypto Bitcoin Minetrix focuses on the two most popular Bitcoin investment themes – mining and staking By combining the popular themes of ERC-20 token staking and Bitcoin mining, Bitcoin Minetrix has struck upon a rich seam with a pitch to market participants that is sure to appeal. There are already 383,179 BTCMTX staked in the Ethereum-based smart contract, according to the desktop dashboard. Rewards for stakers are generated at a rate of 158.5 BTCMTX per ETH block, over a two-year period. The current annual percentage yield (APY) is 108,739%, although this will reduce',\n",
       "  \"Check out these luxurious homes owned by the stars Analysis suggests investors are taking bitcoin off exchanges for long-term holding. In the past month, nearly 18,000 bitcoins, representing a decrease of nearly 1%, have been withdrawn from cryptocurrency exchanges, as per CryptoQuant data. This suggests they want to hold the digital asset because they expect a future price rise. The consensus amongst traders is that prices could rise if one of the spot bitcoin ETF applications that have been filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is approved. A spot bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) is a financial product that investors hope will open the gateway for mainstream capital to flood the crypto market. However, this week US regulators chose to postpone making a decision on more of the ETF filings. This time it involved the highly anticipated ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF. On Tuesday the SEC delayed its ruling on the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, and a similar filing from fund manager Global X. Ark Investment Management and 21Shares have been seeking an ETF approval since 2021. They made their latest spot bitcoin ETF application in April. After the filing, the SEC said it needed more time to rule, setting a deadline for November 11. However, the SEC said on Tuesday it would now take until January 10 to come to a decision on the application.
